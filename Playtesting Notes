Sword Boxing Prototype Playtesting Notes
Left side attack/Right side defense (good way to differentiate)
Controls were discussed prior to actual playing (two players to playtest)
Player 2 started spamming buttons and Player 1 followed
3 Matches in total where the last two devolved to spamming buttons taking advantage of endlag and vulnerability
Both players use both hands to utilize the control layout on one keyboard
*No Stamina or dodging (exact animations) Needs Stamina to Priorize a sense of balancing
Player 1/Original GGD Designer says animations are needed for counterplay  and prototype models are unclear like the sword and block and dodges to come across as such which made gameplay confusing
Player 2 - Expecting for the game to play as a traditional fighting game where you can move left and right. Says that they half expected what the game played out and what experience was intended.
